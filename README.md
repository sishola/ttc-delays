Living in Toronto, we have all experience delays taking the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC).
This project examines the relationship between TTC transportation modes (Subway, Streetcars and Buses) & routes, day of week, time of day, weather and ongoing events in order to establish how these may contribute to delays. Questions asked include:
* Does weather impact Subway delays?
* Does weather impact Bus/Streetcar delays?
* Does day of the week impact Subway delays?
* Does day of the week impact Bus/Streetcar delays?
* Do Holidays impact Subway delays?
* Do Holidays impact Bus/Streetcar delays?
* Does the subway line impact delays?
* Does bus/streetcar route impact delays?
