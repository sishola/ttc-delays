# ttc-delays

Our research question is: What factors go into TTC delays?

* Sub-Topics:
    * Does weather impact Subway delays?
    * Does weather impact Bus/Streetcar delays?
    * Does day of the week impact Subway delays?
    * Does day of the week impact Bus/Streetcar delays?
    * Do Holidays impact Subway delays?
    * Do Holidays impact Bus/Streetcar delays?
    * Does the subway line impact delays?
    * Does bus/streetcar route impact delays?
    
* For each of the sub-topics we will:
    1) Create a subset dataframe of our master data that can answer the sub-topic
    2) Create a Hypothesis question with No: & Na: statements
    3) Choose appropriate statistical test to apply to hypothesis
    4) Report the results from the testing
    5) Build a plot that shows the data being tested
    
    

ALTERNATIVE:

Our research question is: How does weather impact TTC delays?

    * Seasonal impact
    * Relationship between incidents & weather
